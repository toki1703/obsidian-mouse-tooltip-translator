## Three Key Strengths

### 1. Hover Translation That Keeps You in the Flow
No need to switch to a browser. Simply hover over a word or sentence and a popup instantly shows its meaning. Leverages Google's dictionary feature (POS) to display parts of speech, detailed definitions, and transliteration.

### 2. A Hybrid Engine for Every Use Case
**Speed** — Blazing-fast Google / Google GTX  
**Precision** — Reliable DeepL / Bing / Yandex / Papago  
**Context** — Context-aware LLM (OpenAI-compatible / Ollama / LM Studio)

Assign the best engine independently for hover, text selection, and full-page translation.

### 3. A Vocabulary Book That Turns Reading into an Asset
Every lookup is automatically accumulated in a sidebar vocabulary book. Sort by view count, last reviewed date, or alphabetical order, and filter between words and sentences for efficient review.

## What's New in v1.3.8

- **Enhanced page translation**: Added reverse-lookup feature — hover over a translated paragraph to see the original text in a tooltip
- **LLM support**: Local AI translation via Ollama / LM Studio, and support for OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **Smart filter**: Option to hide tooltips when source and target language are the same or when translated text is identical to input
- **Temperature setting**: Adjust generation randomness per LLM engine

## Usage

1. Enable the plugin in Obsidian

3. Select a translation engine and target language
4. Hover over a word or select text to show a translation tooltip

Press `Esc` to close the tooltip.

### Page Translation

Switch to **Reading View**, then click the language icon (🌐) in the view header or run the **"Translate current page"** command. A progress bar is displayed while each block is being translated. Click the icon again (or run the **"Restore original"** command) to revert. You can also cancel the translation with the ✕ button on the progress bar.

After translation, hover over any paragraph to see the original text in a tooltip.

### Vocabulary Book

Click the book icon in the ribbon or run the **"Open vocabulary book"** command to open the sidebar panel. All past translations are listed with their view counts, and can be sorted by view count, last reviewed date, or alphabetical order, and filtered by words or sentences.
